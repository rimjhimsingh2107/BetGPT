## 🚀 Tomorrow Morning - Simple 3-Step Process

### Step 1: Open Terminal (5 minutes before demo)
```bash
cd /Users/rimjhim/Desktop/SELFPROJECTS/betgpt
```

### Step 2: Run Pre-Check (30 seconds)
```bash
bash pre-demo-check.sh
```
This will:
- Verify Python & Node.js
- Clear any stuck processes
- Test backend functionality
- Confirm frontend is ready

### Step 3: Start BetGPT (wait 45 seconds)
```bash
bash start.sh
```
This will:
- Start backend on http://localhost:5000
- Start frontend on http://localhost:3000
- Automatically open browser

**IMPORTANT: Wait 45 seconds for data to load from APIs!**

### Step 4: Pre-Cache (click all tabs)
1. Click **Leaderboard** tab - wait 5 seconds
2. Click **Analytics** tab - wait 5 seconds
3. Click **Portfolio** tab - wait 5 seconds

This pre-loads all data so it appears instantly during your demo!

## 🎤 Your 3-Minute Demo Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
"BetGPT uses AI sentiment analysis to find when prediction markets are mispriced. It compares crowd odds with real-world probability estimates from news, crypto trends, and external signals - then gives actionable buy/sell recommendations with quantified confidence."

### Leaderboard Tab (60 seconds)
1. "Markets are sorted by AI-detected inefficiency"
2. Click top market to expand
3. "The crowd thinks 43%, but AI estimates 68% - a 25 point gap"
4. "BUY YES with 82% confidence and +13% expected ROI"
5. Show AI reasoning section
6. "Every prediction is transparent and explainable"

### Analytics Tab (60 seconds)
1. Click Analytics tab
2. "This shows collective irrationality across different categories"
3. Point to Politics bar: "67% inefficiency - emotions running high"
4. Show pie chart: "Distribution of BUY vs SELL opportunities"
5. "We can see which market types are most prone to emotional trading"

### Portfolio Tab (60 seconds)
1. Click Portfolio tab
2. "This simulates what happens if you follow BetGPT's recommendations"
3. Point to stats: "70% win rate with +16% ROI"
4. Show best/worst trade cards
5. Scroll trade history
6. "AI successfully identified profitable opportunities"

### Closing (30 seconds)
"Real-time updates every 60 seconds. Multi-source data fusion. Transparent AI with quantified confidence. Built with Python Flask, React, and live APIs from Polymarket, Manifold, NewsAPI, and CoinGecko. Thank you!"

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing?
- **Wait 30-45 seconds** - APIs are loading
- Click the "Refresh" button
- APIs might be rate limited (normal for free tiers)

### Port Already in Use?
```bash
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
bash start.sh
```

### Frontend Won't Load?
- Press Ctrl+C twice
- Run `bash start.sh` again
- Wait for "Compiled successfully" message

### Complete Restart?
```bash
# Stop everything
Ctrl+C (twice in terminal)

# Clear ports
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Start fresh
bash start.sh
```
